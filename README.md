## Part 1 Analysis of Selection Algorithms

In this experiment we will be running the deterministic and randomized selection algorithms on varying data sizes (100000, 1000000 elements) and varying data types (sorted, random, reversed sorted).

In order to run the code to generate data to analyze, you can run:

```
python3 assignment_6_part_1.py
```

This will output the results to your terminal. I have captured my results to the `results_part_1.txt` file for the run that I am using in my analysis.

## Part 2 Elementary Data Structures

In this section, we implement arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, and linked lists. The implementation exists in `assignment_6_part_2.py`. 

In order to run the code to execute the demonstration of the usage of these elementary data structures, you can run:

```
python3 assignment_6_part_2.py
```

This will output the results to your terminal. I have captured my results to the `results_part_2.txt`.
